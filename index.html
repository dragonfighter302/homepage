                  <h2>Resume</h2>
                  <p>Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He grew up in Seattle,
                    Washington, with an amazing and supportive family who encouraged his interest in computers at an
                    early age. He dropped out of college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen.
                    Today,
                    Bill co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with Melinda French Gates, where he works to
                    give
                    his wealth back to society.
                    Bill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His late father, William H. Gates Sr., was a Seattle
                    attorney and one of the co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His late mother, Mary
                    Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way
                    International. Bill has three children.</p>

              <h3>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h3>
              <p>These days Bill focuses most of his time on the work he is doing through his foundation. People are
                often surprised to hear him say that this work has a lot in common with his work at Microsoft. In both
                cases, he gets to bring together smart people and collaborate with them to solve big, tough problems.
                Bill is gratified to know that the foundation and its many partners are helping people all over the
                world live healthier, more productive lives.
